## How to run
1. The package is sorted in a way it can run with one script per question, automatically.
2. Experiment scripts:
    a. NN.py - Contains the neural network implementation
    b. NN_functions.py - Contains important functions for the Neural Network
    c. perceptron.py: Contains the perceptron implementation
    d. data_loader.py: Contains the code to load the data
    e. sample_run.py: a sample script demonstrating usage of the code
    f. data/: Directory containing the data for experimentation
    g. **run.py**: all in one script to turning parameters and generate learning curves, the average accuracy of each parameter setting will be record to a csv file.
